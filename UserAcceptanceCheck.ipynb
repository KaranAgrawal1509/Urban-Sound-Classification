    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "For this project we will be using the “UrbanSound8k” dataset, which is publicly available for academic use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The audio files are in \".wav\" format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The samples are around 4 seconds in length. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each sound sample is labeled with the class to which it belongs. After downloading the dataset, we see that it consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Audio files in the ‘audio’ folder: It has 10 sub-folders named ‘fold1’ through ‘fold10’. Each sub-folder contains a number of ‘.wav’ audio samples eg. ‘fold1/103074–7–1–0.wav’\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metadata in the ‘metadata’ folder: It has a file ‘UrbanSound8K.csv’ that contains information about each audio sample in the dataset such as its filename, its class label, the ‘fold’ sub-folder location, and so on. The class label is a numeric Class ID from 0–9 for each of the 10 classes. eg. The number 0 means air conditioner, 1 is a car horn, and so on. \n"
